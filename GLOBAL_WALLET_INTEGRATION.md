# Global Wallet Integration Fix

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

**Issue**: Wallet connection state was not shared globally across the website. Each hook (`useCreatorToken`, `usePostToken`) was managing its own wallet connection independently, causing the "missing revert data" error when the wallet wasn't connected to the right network.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Unified Wallet State Management**
- **Before**: Each hook managed its own wallet connection
- **After**: All hooks now use the global `WalletContext` from `context/WalletContext.tsx`

### **2. Files Updated**

#### **`CLAPO-FE/app/hooks/useCreatorToken.ts`**
```typescript
// Before (local wallet state)
const [signer, setSigner] = useState<ethers.Signer | null>(null);
const [isConnected, setIsConnected] = useState(false);
const [address, setAddress] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [isConnecting, setIsConnecting] = useState(false);

// After (global wallet context)
const { provider, signer, address, isConnecting, connect, disconnect } = useWalletContext();
const isConnected = !!signer && !!address;
```

#### **`CLAPO-FE/app/hooks/usePostToken.ts`**
```typescript
// Same changes as useCreatorToken
const { provider, signer, address, isConnecting, connect, disconnect } = useWalletContext();
const isConnected = !!signer && !!address;
```

### **3. Key Changes Made**

#### **Wallet Connection Logic**
```typescript
// Before (each hook created its own connection)
const connectWallet = async () => {
  const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
  await provider.send("eth_requestAccounts", []);
  const signer = await provider.getSigner();
  // ... local state management
};

// After (uses global wallet context)
const connectWallet = async () => {
  await connect(); // Uses global wallet context
};
```

#### **Contract Setup**
```typescript
// Before (manual contract setup in each hook)
useEffect(() => {
  // Complex wallet connection logic
}, []);

// After (reacts to global wallet state)
useEffect(() => {
  if (signer && address) {
    const contract = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, CONTRACT_ABI, signer);
    setContract(contract);
  } else {
    setContract(null);
  }
}, [signer, address]);
```

## 🔧 **Technical Benefits**

### **1. Consistent Wallet State**
- ✅ Wallet connection state is now shared across the entire app
- ✅ No more duplicate wallet connection logic
- ✅ Single source of truth for wallet status

### **2. Better Error Handling**
- ✅ Network errors are handled at the global level
- ✅ Consistent error messages across all components
- ✅ Better user experience with unified connection flow

### **3. Improved Performance**
- ✅ No duplicate wallet connection attempts
- ✅ Shared provider and signer instances
- ✅ Reduced memory usage

## 🎨 **User Experience Improvements**

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ Wallet connection on home page didn't work on profile page
- ❌ "Missing revert data" errors when wallet not connected to Monad testnet
- ❌ Inconsistent wallet state across different pages
- ❌ Multiple wallet connection prompts

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Wallet connection works globally across all pages
- ✅ Consistent wallet state everywhere
- ✅ Single wallet connection for entire app
- ✅ Better error handling and user feedback

## 🚀 **How It Works Now**

### **Global Wallet Flow:**
1. **User connects wallet** on any page (home, profile, etc.)
2. **Global WalletContext** manages the connection state
3. **All hooks** (`useCreatorToken`, `usePostToken`) automatically get the connection
4. **Contract instances** are created using the global signer
5. **All pages** show consistent wallet status

### **Network Configuration:**
- Added `NetworkConfig` component for Monad testnet setup
- Users can easily add Monad testnet to their wallet
- Clear instructions for network configuration

## ✅ **Status: Fixed and Working**

The wallet connection now works globally across the entire website:
- ✅ Home page wallet connection applies to profile page
- ✅ No more "missing revert data" errors
- ✅ Consistent wallet state everywhere
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Unified wallet management

Users can now connect their wallet once and use creator tokens throughout the entire application! 🎉
